Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about a car's fuel efficiency. The car can drive 24 miles on a gallon of gas in the city and 36 miles on a gallon on the highway. I need to find out how many gallons of gas the car uses when driving a combination of city and highway miles. Specifically, the trip is 126 miles in total, with 21 miles in the city and the rest on the highway.

First, I should break down the problem into parts. I know the total miles driven in the city and the total miles driven on the highway. The city part is 21 miles, and the highway part is the remaining 126 - 21 = 105 miles.

Next, I need to calculate how many gallons of gas are used for each part. For the city driving, since the car does 24 miles per gallon, I can find the gallons used by dividing the city miles by the city fuel efficiency. So that's 21 miles divided by 24 miles per gallon. Similarly, for the highway, it's 105 miles divided by 36 miles per gallon.

After calculating both, I'll add the two amounts together to get the total gallons used for the entire trip. That should give me the answer.
