      <h2>McDonald's Homepage Redesign Project</h2>
      <p>
        This project is a comprehensive redesign of the McDonald's homepage aimed at improving overall usability, enhancing visual hierarchy, 
        and increasing user engagement. We focus on addressing issues such as interface clutter, intrusive banners, and visual overload while 
        preserving the core functionality that users rely on.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the following slides, you will see detailed explanations of the problems with the current design, interactive wireframes of both the 
        existing and proposed layouts, and interactive previews of pixel-perfect mockups that bring the redesign to life.
      </p>

    <!-- Slide 2: Description of Problem -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide2">
      <h2>A) Description of Problem</h2>
      <p>
        While McDonald's iconic branding is instantly recognizable, the current homepage design has some notable UI/UX concerns:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Intrusive T&C Banner:</strong> A large banner about Terms &amp; Conditions pushes the main content down, disrupting the browsing experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple Competing Promos:</strong> Several large promotional blocks (e.g., breakfast ads, McCrispy offers) appear at once, causing confusion about what users should focus on first.</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of Clear CTAs:</strong> The navigation and primary call-to-action elements are not highlighted, making it harder for users to quickly find actions like “Order Now” or “Find a Restaurant.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Below is an interactive preview of the current (original) McDonald's homepage. Use this preview to understand the starting point for our redesign.

    <!-- Slide 3: Wireframe of Existing UI -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide3">
      <h2>B) Wireframe of Existing UI</h2>
      <p>
        The wireframe below represents a simplified, monochromatic blueprint of the existing McDonald's homepage. It strips away color and imagery 
        to focus on the layout, content organization, and interaction flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this wireframe, notice the prominent Terms &amp; Conditions banner, two large promotional sections (breakfast and McCrispy), and the 
        placement of the navigation. This simplified view helps us pinpoint areas where the content hierarchy can be improved.
      </p>

    </div>

    <!-- Slide 4: Wireframe of Redesigned UI -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide4">
      <h2>C) Wireframe of Redesigned UI</h2>
      <p>
        The redesigned wireframe reorganizes the content to create a more intuitive flow. We condensed the Terms &amp; Conditions banner, introduced 
        a single hero section with a clear call-to-action, and placed secondary promos in separate cards to reduce visual clutter.
      </p>
      <p>
        This wireframe acts as a blueprint for the new design, ensuring that the improved structure supports both existing functionalities and new 
        enhancements such as highlighting “Order Now” in the navigation and simplifying promotional blocks.

    <!-- Slide 5: Pixel Mocks of Redesigned UI -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide5">
      <h2>D) Pixel Mocks of Redesigned UI</h2>
      <p>
        The final redesign is shown in the pixel‑perfect mockup below. This version incorporates a more balanced color palette, 
        clearer typography, and better calls-to-action (e.g., a standout “Order Now” button).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, the improved layout, updated promotional sections, and simplified Terms &amp; Conditions banner work together to create 
        a user-friendly experience that is both visually appealing and highly functional.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below is an interactive preview of the redesigned homepage. Notice how the updated design clearly differentiates between 
        the hero section and secondary promos, giving users a clear path to ordering and exploring deals.

    <!-- Slide 6: Side-by-Side Comparison -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide6">
      <h2>E) Side-by-Side Comparison</h2>
      <p>
        To clearly illustrate the improvements, the following side-by-side comparison displays the original and redesigned homepages.
        This comparison highlights key differences such as layout clarity, navigation improvements, and visual hierarchy enhancements.
      </p>
      <div class="comparison-container" style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
        <div style="width:49%;">
          <h3>Before</h3>
          <iframe src="before-mcd.html" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:1px solid #ccc;"></iframe>
        </div>
        <div style="width:49%;">
          <h3>After</h3>
          <iframe src="after-mcd.html" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:1px solid #ccc;"></iframe>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Key Differences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Condensed T&C Banner:</strong> The large banner was replaced with a smaller, dismissible notice, preventing content from being pushed too far down.</li>
        <li><strong>Single Hero Section:</strong> A clear hero area focuses on a primary CTA (“Order Now”), while secondary promos are placed below in distinct cards.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Navigation:</strong> “Order Now” and “Find a Restaurant” are highlighted for quick user access, reducing friction.</li>
        <li><strong>Visual Hierarchy:</strong> Cleaner spacing, fewer competing elements, and better color contrast help direct attention effectively.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Navigation Buttons for Slides -->

    <h2>Placeholder Page</h2>
    <p>This is a dummy page for interactive navigation. It serves as a stand-in for pages that would normally contain more detailed content.</p>
